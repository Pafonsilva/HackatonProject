# HackatonProject

This is my team's project for an Hackaton we participated in near the end of the Bootcamp.
In it we had 24 to come up with a product based on a theme given to us (the general theme was Tarantino movies and their main songs, ours ended up being Once uppon a time in Hollywood and California Dreaming).
We made a website where you play a guessing game to find out which celebrity the clues pertain to. At first I used an API to fetch info about the celebrities, but no good ones were available for free.

In the end we used Javascript, HTML, CSS, Spring Boot, and some Bootstrap to make a website that redirects you through the necessary pages, and where you need to create an account that is saved into a database of users to keep score,
with funcioning login authentication.
