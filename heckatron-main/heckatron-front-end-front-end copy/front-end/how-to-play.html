    <h1>How it works</h1>
    <p>1. Clue Reception: As a player, you will receive a carefully crafted clue related to a specific actor. 
        These clues can range from descriptions of their iconic roles, key attributes, or even hints about their personal life.</p>

    <p>2. Guessing Time: Once you've received the clue, it's time to put on your thinking cap! Analyze the provided information and think critically about which actor fits the description. 
         Your goal is to correctly identify the actor based solely on the given clue.</p> 

    <p>3. Input Your Guess: Using the game interface, input the name of the actor you believe matches the clue.
        Make sure to double-check your spelling â€“ precision is key!</p>

    <p>4. Reveal and Reward: After submitting your guess, the game will reveal whether your guess is correct or not. If you've guessed correctly, you'll be rewarded with progress within the game. 
        The more accurate and quick your guess, the more points you can earn.</p>
